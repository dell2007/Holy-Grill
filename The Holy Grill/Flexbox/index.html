          <h2>Why do we complicate things?</h2> <br>
          <p>Since our birth, you and I were throwing in a pile of complicated things, in all research, deep knowledge of everything, to look deeper in, to know the picture is bigger than what it looks but is it?
            I don’t think so, many of the times we end up looking like a fool because we concentrate so much on looking for more when things were in front of us most of the time.
            Let’s look at this way when you learn something new or try to grasp something you don’t know you pay attention to it but as soon it starts getting into your mind you declutter the excess information and keep the essence of it.
            The same is with everything else. Simplicity is not less of things but the reduction of something to its essence, keeping only its core nature and nothing additional.
